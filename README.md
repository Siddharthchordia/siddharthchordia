## 🚀 What I Work On

### 🧠 Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning
- Deep Learning (LSTM, CNN, Attention)
- ML-driven decision & scoring systems
- Explainable AI & ensemble learning
- AI-assisted analysis and reporting

### 🧩 Backend Development & Systems
- Python, Django, REST APIs
- Relational databases (PostgreSQL, SQLite)
- ORM design & complex data relationships
- Authentication, authorization, permissions
- Background jobs & schedulers
- API design & integration

### ⚙️ DevOps & Engineering Practices
- Docker & containerized development
- CI/CD with GitHub Actions
